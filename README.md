Less is known of "The Mule" than of any character of comparable signifigance to Galactic history. His real name is unknown; his early life mere conjecture. Even the period of his greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes of his antagonists and, principally, through those of a young bride. </p>_

### What is MULE?

**MULE** is a centralised repository for the data acquisition and analysis software used within the University of Manchester's neutrino lab.

The functionality of this repository should cover:
- **Data acquisition** and **processing** for **PMTs** and **SiPMs** interfaced with CAEN hardware/software,
- **Analysis software** and scripts implemented directly upon the acquired data or provided for use once data is processed,
- **Adequate documentation** to allow for simple use of the respective tools provided within this repository.

## Usage

Implement description of full usage, perhaps move this section to docs.
